# Natural Language Processing - IMBd Reviews classification

This is a project about natural language processing for classify reviews of IMBd.
I created a supervised learning model that categorize reviews into positive or negative.

## Dataset

The dataset is a list of 50.000 IMbd reviews from https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews.

Each review is classified by positive or negative.
I divide the dataset into a training and test sets, using the training set for training the model and the test set for evaluate how good it does.
